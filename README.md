# Local Music Library to Spotify Playlists

If you grew up in the 90's or early 2000's I bet you have at least some music in the form of MP3 files somewhere on your devices. Nowadays in the era of streaming platforms I very rarely find myself needing to play my favorite songs using physical files - its ALL out there. Now, the problem is when you would like to transition to exclusively use streaming platform - it would take ages to do find, search, like and create playlists if your music library is large.

Local2Spotify will enable you to do just that. Simply select a folder and it will generate a Spotify playlist for you. You will be able to **preview tracks**, tick to **accept** or choose a **different item** for each found track, **edit playlist name** and once list is complied **Save to Process**.

**The only caveat is - your library must be neat, meaning - file names should have nice formatting so the algorithm is able to dissect it into parts and perform search in the Spotify database.**

Quick and easy! Happy streaming folks.
